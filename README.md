# Baseball-Text-Game
My Portfolio Project for CS 101 on CodeCademy.com

Working Baseball text-based game with ASCII art graphics.

Play a three inning game of baseball! You can input where you want to pitch/aim the bat and which type of pitch you want to throw/expect.
After the inputs, the game updates the scoreboard and shows the outcome of the pitch! Try and see if you can beat the computer!
